## CARG

This is still somewhat of a work in progress as I haven't really done some
other things yet that I want to do.
I don't entirely remember where I got the original python code from pretty sure I wrote it based on a blog 
but can't remember the blog so it's 
missing in the citations gonna lie.
The Julia file is partially borrowed with like 30 - 40% written by me to get
the functionality that I wanted.
